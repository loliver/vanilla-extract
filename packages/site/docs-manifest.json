Write your styles in TypeScript (or JavaScript) with locally scoped class names and CSS Variables, then generate static CSS files at build time.  Basically, it’s “CSS Modules-in-TypeScript” but with scoped CSS Variables + heaps more.  > 🚧 &nbsp; Please note, this is an alpha release.  🔥 &nbsp; All styles generated at build time — just like Sass, Less, etc.  ✨ &nbsp; Minimal abstraction over standard CSS.  🌳 &nbsp; Locally scoped class names — just like CSS Modules.  🚀 &nbsp; Locally scoped CSS Variables, @keyframes and @font-face rules.  🎨 &nbsp; High-level theme system with support for simultaneous themes.
